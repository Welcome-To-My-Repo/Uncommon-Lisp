Uncommon Lisp
=============

Like Common Lisp, but better.
-----------------------------

The modern family of Lisp languages sort of... suck. This is why I made
Uncommon Lisp. It's designed to be a "true" general purpose Lisp.


Uncommon Lisp is designed with the following principals:
* Be like ANSI Common Lisp.
* Be small, within reason.
* Be future-proof
* Be entirely self-contained
