Uncommon Lisp
=============

Like Common Lisp, but better.
-----------------------------

The modern family of Lisp languages sort of... suck. This is why I made
Uncommon Lisp. It's designed to be a `true` general purpose language.

	* ANSI Common Lisp is too big to use realistically and it's implementations are janky and hard to use.

	*Scheme isn't really an anything-purpose language. It's mostly used for prototyping other, actually useful languages.

	* Clojure is just a harder way to write a subset of Java.
